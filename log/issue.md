## Wind data
1. The empty data can be replaced with the nearest data, so that the loading time can be reduced.
2. Current resolution is 0.5 degrees, and the file size is 1.44 MB, leaving space for increasing resolution. Try to use the original data.
3. The wind data of the site can be stored.

## Power calculation
1. Currently the wind data is at 10 m, leading to underestimation of power output.
2. Currently the way of summarising wind data is just getting the average wind speed, leading to underestimation of power output.

## Optimisation algorithm
1. The current algorithm can be optimised by pairwise calculation (and even pre-computation)
2. Other algorithms can be tried.
