## Power calculation
1. Currently the wind data is at 10 m, leading to underestimation of power output.
2. Currently the way of summarising wind data is just getting the average wind speed, leading to underestimation of power output.
3. The wind turbine spec is not what the Whitelee Windfarm is using, leading to underestimation.

## Optimisation algorithm
1. The current algorithm can be optimised by pre-computation.
2. Other algorithms can be tried.

## Future direction
1. Support user defined area
2. Support locally uploaded GeoJson file.
